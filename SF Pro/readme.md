## SF Pro
Fonts used on iOS and macOS. It was named **SF UI** during the transition of [SF family](../SF%20Compact/) on Apple Watch before it got the name **SF** (**SF Pro** is the name for developers, which is added more glyphs). Previously, it was restricted to paid-only developers or developers who joined the Enterprise program. Today, you can get it at https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ (macOS is required to open DMG file, there's no application on Windows to open it). For ZIP file to open on Windows, https://developer.apple.com/fonts/downloads/SFPro.zip, however, it is not kept up-to-date as Apple doesn't maintain it anymore.
